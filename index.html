        <p>
          My name is Ronan, and I live in Santa Barbara with my mom, dad, and
          older brother. I enjoy learning new topics, like how to create a
          website. Some hobbies of mine are playing video games with my friends
          and playing school sports for fun. An Subject that I enjoy in school
          is History. I enjoy learning about early civilizations' politics. My
          favorite food is pesto pasta because it is not that hard to make and
          has a distinguished taste. I enjoy riding my bike around my
          neighborhood every weekend or when I have the time. The photo on the
          web page is a picture of me on earth day riding my bike to school.

        <p>
          I have two cats. The first cat is named Simba, he has orange hair. The
          second one is percy and he is small and has grey hair.
